Creative Tilt: Endless runners are games that to me are not games worth the praise and attention they get.
I believe them to be vapid, shallow, and not actually games that are games in the formal sense. No strategy
or conscious change in behavior can really affect the outcome - not least because there is literally no win state.
To that end, this "game" is really a fully functional endless runner - just one in which the player's task is to
keep the computer playing it for as long as it and the player can stand. (Due to the unusual nature of this game,
I consulted with Professor Altice about this to get his approval. I believe he called it "conceptual art."

### UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES PLAY THIS GAME IF YOU ARE EPILEPTIC OR PRONE TO SEIZURES.
