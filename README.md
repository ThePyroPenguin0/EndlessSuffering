Creative Tilt: Endless runners are games that to me are not games worth the praise and attention they get.
I believe them to be vapid, shallow, and not actually games that are games in the formal sense. No strategy
or conscious change in behavior can really affect the outcome - not least because there is literally no win state.
To that end, this "game" is really a fully functional endless runner - just one in which the player's task is to
keep the computer playing it for as long as it and the player can stand.

### UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES PLAY THIS GAME IF YOU ARE EPILEPTIC OR PRONE TO SEIZURES.
